# V4D: V4Design Project Ontology for reuse of 2D and 3D data
V4Design develops a platform that provides architects, video game creators and designers of any expertise with innovative tools necessary to enhance and simplify the creative phase of the designing process. A core idea behind V4Design is to reuse (i) 2D: movies, documentaries paintings and images from other artwork and (ii) 3D: printable models, 3D reconstructions and meshes and re-purpose it in a way that is useful for architecture and video game designers. This ontology is a part of WP5 to publish Linked Open Data.
